###Loops

The objective was to write a program that starts by reading what is on Input Port 3 and then displaying that on Output Port 0.  One less than that is then displayed on Port 1 and one less than what is on Port 1 is displayed on Port 2.  The program then decremented what was on Port 0, then decremented what was on Port 1, then decremented what was on Port 2.  This process is continued in an infinite loop. The Target program end was $10 which was met.
